# Listen for webhooks

This guide provides information about working with Webhooks using the 
[dashboard](./dashboard) or the [Livepeer API](./api).

- Use webhooks to listen for video lifecycle events
- Check webhook signatures to ensure incoming webhook requests are coming from
  Livepeer

## About Webhooks

Livepeer Studio uses webhooks to communicate with your application
asynchronously when events for your stream occur. For example, you may want to
know when a stream has become `active` or `idle`, so that you can surface this
information to viewers. When these events happen, you can make a `POST` request
to a URL that you specify.

## Types of Events
