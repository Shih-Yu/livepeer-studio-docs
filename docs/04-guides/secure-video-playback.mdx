# Secure video playback

You can set a playback policy for a livestream to secure video playback.

Your playback policy can be either:
- `public` - No access control is applied to the asset
- `jwt` - A JSON Web Token (JWT) is required to playback the asset

If you set your stream's playback policy to JWT, you will 
need to sign a token with a signing key and put it in the playback URL
to be able to playback your stream.

## Step 1: Create a livestream with a signed playback policy

Create a livestream with a signed playback policy. The playback policy can 
be specified when creating a new live stream, or can be added to an existing 
[live stream](https://docs.livepeer.studio/reference/api/update-stream).

## Step 2: Create a signing key

A signing key is used to sign JWTs and are necessary to make a stream private.
You can find more information about the response object [here](https://docs.livepeer.studio/reference/api/create-signing-keys).

:::caution
The `privateKey` field generated by this request is available only
on creation and cannot be retrieved later.

```js
const response = await fetch(
  "https://livepeer.studio/api/access-control/signing-key",
  {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.API_TOKEN}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    }
  }
);

const responseObject = await response.json();
```

## Step 3: Sign the JWT

After setting up your livestream and signing key, you will need to sign the JWT so you can use it.

<CodeBlockTabs>
<CodeBlockTabItem value="JavaScript" label="JavaScript">

```js
// use the signAccessJwt export from `livepeer` in Node.JS
import { signAccessJwt } from 'livepeer/crypto';

const accessControlPrivateKey = process.env.ACCESS_CONTROL_PRIVATE_KEY;
const accessControlPublicKey =
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ACCESS_CONTROL_PUBLIC_KEY;
 
const handler = async () => {
  // we sign the JWT and return it to the user
  const token = await signAccessJwt({
    privateKey: accessControlPrivateKey,
    publicKey: accessControlPublicKey,
    issuer: 'https://livepeerjs.org',
    // playback ID to include in the JWT
    playbackId: playbackId,
    // expire the JWT in 1 hour
    expiration: '1h',
    // custom metadata to include
    custom: {
      userId: 'user-id-1',
    },
  });

  return token
}
```

</CodeBlockTabItem>
</CodeBlockTabs>


## Step 4: Include the JSON Web Token (JWT) in the media URL

Your livestream is now privately secured! To playback a JWT secured video,
you will need to add the token to your URL as such:
```https://livepeercdn.com/hls/4be03pfwk16x18ve/index.m3u8?jwt=$JWT_TOKEN```
