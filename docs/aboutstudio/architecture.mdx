Architecture and workflows of the Livepeer Studio features are presented with the Livepeer network decentralized transcoding (a.k.a. Web3):

- Livestreaming
- Multistreaming
- On Demand
- Mint

## Options for Streaming

There are several options for streaming workflow according to devices being used, including but not limited to these commonly used methods:

- Via a streaming software
- In-Browser streaming

> **Note** To learn more about how to work with these methods, ***See*** Our [Start Livestreaming](/guides/livestreaming/tutorial) guide.


## Livestream Workflow

- An incoming audio/video feed from a device passes through a streaming software like OBS or a web browser via WebRTC
- Livepeer Studio sends the feed to the Livepeer network for transcoding
- The feed gets transcoded to multiple renditions and sent to the CDN
- The CDN sends specific rendition of the feed based on the viewers device and network capabilities when a request is made

## Multistream Workflow

- An incoming audio/video feed from a device passes through a streaming software like OBS or a web browser via WebRTC at the same time, Livepeer Studio will redirect this feed into other streaming platforms
- Livepeer Studio sends the original feed to the Livepeer network for transcoding
feed gets transcoded to multiple renditions and sent to the CDN
- The CDN sends specific rendition of the feed based on the viewers device and network capabilities when a request is made

## On Demand Workflow

- An asset can be provided by **either** a downloadable URL link **or** by uploading a `.mp4` file
  - Importing a URL
    - Asset in downloadable link is transcoded in the Livepeer Network, gets passed back to Livepeer Studio and saved in storage
  - Uploading a file  
    - Generates a URL for storage if `Upload` option is used
    - File provided itranscoded in the Livepeer Network, gets passed back to Livepeer Studio and saved in storage
  - Stored assest now contains the `playbackUrl` used for viewing
  - The CDN sends specific rendition of the asset based on the viewers device and network capabilities when a request is made

## Mint Workflow

- Livepeer Studio takes provided `.mp4` asset and metadata provided by the user
- Write and deploy the smart contract
- Pass in the metadata from uploaded asset
- Sends asset to Livepeer's decentralized transcoding network for transcoding
- Mint the video NFT by calling the Ethereum blockchain (Polygon layer 2 solution is used for mosre cost effective gas fees)
