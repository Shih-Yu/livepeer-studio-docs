## About the Livepeer Studio API

The Livepeer Studio API is a live video streaming API. You or the client can configure details for live broadcasting software, generate a playback URL for stream viewers, get usage data about your stream sessions and more. Explore this Livepeer Studio API reference for more information.


## API Features

| API                                                          | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Stream](/references/stream/)                                | The `stream` object is the core building block of the Livepeer Studio API with configuration data and metadata about all livestream sessions associated with it. |
| [Session](/references/session/)                              | The `session` object is a single livestreaming session, especially important to referencing recorded livestream sessions. |
| [Multistream Target](/references/multistream-target/overview) | The `multistream target` object is a single endpoint to where a `stream` can be multistreamed, i.e. pushing the media from the given stream in real-time (also referred to as `simulcast`). |
| [On Demand](/references/vod/import)                          | In the API, this is referred to as Video-on-Demand (VOD); you can send video files to Livepeer Studio, get them ready for optimized playback, and work with assets, methods for uploading, updating, and monitoring assets. |

## Making requests on the API

You need an API key to make requests of the API.

> **Note:** Livestream Studio Dashboard is intended for viewing and testing work done with the API.  You do not need to create an API key if you are creating and configuring livestreams using only the Livepeer Studio Dashboard.

## Getting an API Key

For information on how to get an API key visit the [`Get an API key`](/guides/livestreaming/api-key) guide.

## Base URL

The API base url is `https://livepeer.studio/api/`

## Authentication

The API uses API keys to authenticate most requests, including all requests associated with creating and retrieving a stream or session object.

The API uses Bearer authentication. You or the client must send an API key in the Authorization header when making requests to protected information:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <api-key>
```

> **Note:** All API requests must be made over HTTPS. API requests without proper authentication will fail.

## Usage

To use an API key, simply add an `Authorization` header to your request with the `Bearer` scheme and the API key as the value. Example:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_key}'
  https://livepeer.studio/api/user/me
```


## Request and Response Formats

As you make requests, the API returns JSON responses.

## Access the API

Explore the [API reference](/references). 


## API Requests

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. API requests without proper authentication will fail.

- The Livepeer.studio API base url is `https://livepeer.studio/api/`. 

- As you make requests, the Livepeer Studio API returns JSON responses.

**For example:**

`Get` a livestream by using the stream `id`
