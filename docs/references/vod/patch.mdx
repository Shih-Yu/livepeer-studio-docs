title: PATCH updating storage
---


`PATCH /asset/:id -d { }` can be used to modify any `asset` that was uploaded with On Demand. It is a single endpoint that can update only the following mutable properties of an asset:

- `name`
- `storage`
- `meta`



## Update Stored Asset


## Updating Asset Name

This will allow the name of the stored asset in Livepeer Studio to be changed.

### Request

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://livepeer.studio/api/asset/{id} \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d { "name": "New name" }
```

## Updating Storage

This allows to add additional storage location of where the assets are to be stored.

>**NOTE:** 
- Currently assets cannot be deleted from the default Livepeer Studio storage. You can  customize any additional storage though. 
- Only IPFS is supported as an additional storge at the moment. We are currently working on support for other decentralized storages like Arweave and Storj.


### Request

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://livepeer.studio/api/asset/{id} \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d {"storage": {"ipfs": {}}}
```

## Updating Metadata

This allows for modifying the metadata of the asset, which is customizable NFT. Since each marketplace has their own standard for the `metatdata` of the NFT, it is up to you to determine which standard to use and fields to include.

### Request

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://livepeer.studio/api/asset/{id} \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d {  "meta": {
        "title": "My awesome video",
        "description": "This is a video of my awesome life",
        "tags": ["awesome", "life", "video"],
    }
  }
```


## Updating Multiple parameters

This allows for modifying the metadata of the asset, which can be used to customize the asset of the NFT metadata. These fields are customizable and are not set.

### Request

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://livepeer.studio/api/asset/{id} \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d {  
  "name": "New name",
  "storage": {"ipfs": {}},
  "meta": {
        "title": "My awesome video",
        "description": "This is a video of my awesome life",
        "tags": ["awesome", "life", "video"],
    }
  }
```


### Response

Returns a `200 OK` response with an object containing the updated properties indicates that the `asset` was succussfully updated.
