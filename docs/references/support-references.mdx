## Custom Domain

The following provides information on how to use a custom domain for livestreaming with Livepeer Studio:

- Livepeer Studio Ingest URL
- Name your URL
- Configure your URL

- Livepeer Ingest URL

The Livepeer Studio.com global-optimized ingest URL is
`rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.studio/live/{stream-key}`.

- Naming your URL
- You can CNAME `rtmp.livepeer.studio` to customize that URL to something with your
brand, e.g. `rtmp.companyname.io`. 

- Configuring your URL

- You can configure this with your DNS
provider.

### Stream delivery via CDN

Playback for all Pro plan streams is delivered via a content delivery network (CDN). The transcoded video stream automatically switches between the transcoded renditions based on the viewers’ available bandwidth, device performance, and
network conditions.

Non-CDN delivery for free tier users is limited to 10 viewers per account.


## Creating Paywall for Your Livestreams

Building paywall is a common approach form monetizing live video content. While
Livepeer Studio does not have a built-in paywall feature, it integrates well with
other tools and platforms.

Example solutions include:

1. [JWPlayer](https://www.jwplayer.com/) allows you to create a password for
   each video asset, or to lock down access to public video altogether via URL
   token signing. Refer to the
   [JWPlayer Livepeer Studio demo app](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-jwplayer-demo)
   for an example integration between JWPlayer and Livepeer Studio.
2. For WordPress sites, there is a
   [rich plugin ecosystem](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/paywall/) that
   provide many different paywall options.
3. You can use application logic to hide the unique Livepeer Studio video playback
   URL behind a custom paywall by default.


## Debugging livestream issues

You can follow these steps to [debug common stream playback issues](https://livepeer.studio/preview/blog/debugging-playback-issues).

1. Log into the Livepeer Studio dashboard the [Livepeer Studio test player](https://livepeer.studio/app/test-player)

1. Locate your playback URL.

[guide](/guides/livestreaming/playback) to find your live
stream playback URL.

## Handling disconnects

Sometimes, after you’ve connected your encoder (for example, OBS) to and
Livepeer Studio RTMP server, the connection drops. For example, this could happen
because of a bug in the encoder software or a problem with the streamer’s
internet connection.

Livepeer Studio has a built-in 5 minute reconnect window, which means that if the
streamer’s encoder disconnects and then reconnects within 5 minutes, the session
will resume. If you are using Livepeer Studio recording feature, the recorded
session will not be split into two separate sessions.

The reconnect window is currently not customizable.


# Reducing latency tips

Livepeer.com routes your live streams to the nearest available datacenter to
ensure your streamers and live stream viewers have a consistent, high quality
experience with the minimum latency Livepeer.com can provide.

These globally-optimized URLs are the best option for nearly all Livepeer.com
users.

- Stream into: `rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.com/live/{stream-key}`
- Playback from: `https://livepeercdn.com/hls/{playbackId}/index.m3u8`

Also, If you created your stream via the Livepeer.com API, confirm your profile
bitrate settings are
[reasonable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http_live_streaming/hls_authoring_specification_for_apple_devices).

Lastly, sometimes, the source stream is causing poor playback performance even
though you are using the globally-optimized URLs above and good bitrate
settings. The source stream is the stream sent from your broadcast software.
Livepeer.com serves the source stream with the transcoded renditions via the
playback URL.

One way to test if the source stream is causing problems is by inputting the
playback URL in the Livepeer.com [Test Player](https://livepeer.com/app/test-player). The Test
Player is only available to logged in users.

First take a look at the Session Ingest Rate graph at the bottom of the page. If
the chart shows a lot of sharp peaks and valleys, this indicates your
broadcasting workflow is unstable. The RTMP stream hitting Livepeer's ingest
server has problems. Try ensuring a stronger internet connection at the source
via a wired ethernet connection or by broadcasting on a more reliable network.

Next, take a look at the left player which shows your source stream, as served
by the Livepeer.com CDN. This player is configured to only playback the highest
resolution available. Except for rare occasions, the highest resolution is the
non-transcoded source stream.

Compare the source in the left player with the transcoded renditions in the
player on the right (ABR). You can manually switch between transcoded renditions
by clicking on the ⋮ symbol in the lower right corner of the player.

If the problems in the source-only stream are also present in the transcoded
renditions, there is something wrong with your source stream. If you can,
instruct the streamer to set the keyframe interval to 2 in their broadcasting
software; this can help. In general, make sure your broadcasting workflow is
stable. If the RTMP stream hitting Livepeer's ingest server has problems, try
ensuring a stronger internet connection at the source via a wired ethernet
connection or by broadcasting on a more reliable network.

## SRT Support

SRT ingest is supported for all users and is currently in Beta. To stream in
SRT, change your stream URL to:

`srt://rtmp.livepeer.studio:2935?streamid={stream-key}`

The SRT ingest URL is also included in the Dashboard, making it easy to copy and
paste. It can be found below the RTMP ingest URL on the Stream Detail page.

There is no need to use a stream key when using the SRT ingest URL, as the
stream key is already included.

Streaming with SRT is compatible with OBS but may not be compatible with all
encoders, including Streamlabs OBS. Please ensure that your encoder is
compatible with SRT.
