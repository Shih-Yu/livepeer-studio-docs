title: Authentication
---


The Livepeer Studio API uses API keys to authenticate most requests, including all
requests associated with creating and retrieving a stream or session object. 

- All API requests must be made over HTTPS. 
- API requests without proper authentication will fail.

The Livepeer Studio API uses Bearer authentication. You or the client must send an
API key in the Authorization header when making requests to protected information:

**For Example:**

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <api-key>
```
