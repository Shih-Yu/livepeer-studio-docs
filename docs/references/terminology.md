|      | ABR                                     | An Internet Video Streaming industry standard term, ABR streaming is known as "Adaptive Bitrate Streaming". The Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) ladder can be considered metaphorically and refers to "the array of segments of different quality and resolution which are available from the streaming server. If the bitrate rises, the logic in a video player can select a larger size file with better quality to play, thus resembling the "climbing up of the ladder". |

|      | Audio                                   | Livepeer Studio has the capability for playing back audio separately from video (with the proper format for transcoding). For example, if you want to playback Audio only streams, once you upload a video with audio, you can turn the video off.<br />See [Audio Only Streams](/guides/livestreaming/playback#audio-only-streams) |

|      |                                         | Flash video format (FLV) was once the most common delivery format for web-based streaming i.e., the only way for a video to play in a browser.<br />  **Advantage:** FLV is commonly available with older browsers. **Disadvantage:** With the standardization of HTML5 and the removal of Flash installed with browsers, its use is being replaced with other protocols. |

|      |                                         | MPEG-4 (MP4) is supported by most modern devices and browsers.<br />  **Advantage:** The high compatibility makes it a popular choice. **Disadvantage:** MP4 requires high overhead. This is relatively complicated for live streams. |

|      | Transcoding                             | Transcoding is the process of taking an input source video in one format andbitrate, and converting it to many output rendition videos with different formats and bitrates such that the video can be played on the majority of the devices in the world at any internet connection speed.<br />Additional details on transcoding can be found in [this blog post](https://livepeer.studio/blog/intro-to-transcoding). |

|      | WebRTC                                  | Web Real-Time Communications (WebRTC) is a set of browser APIs compatible with secure RTP (SRTP). |
|      |                                         | **Advantage:** It has all the properties of RTSP with the added bonus of browser compatibility. **Disadvantage:** It is still relatively new and has not seen much use yet, but promises to be the most prevalent protocol in the near future. |
