title: Quick Start
---

This Quick Start guide includes a step-by-step process to get you started developing an application with the Livepeer Studio API (for `Node.js` and `Axios` apps). With the Livepeer Studio toolkit, you will be able to develop an application that follows our complete livestreaming cycle and best practice guidelines:

- [Create a livestream](/guides#create-a-livestream)
- [Record a  livestream](/guides#record-a-livestream)
- [Play back the livestream](/guides/#list-recorded-sessions) using the [Livepeer Studio API](/references) with `Node.js` and `Axios`

**Optional**
- [Check a recorded video](/guides#check-a-recorded-video)

> **Note:** Athough the above is not restricted to `Node.js` and `Axios` -- Livepeer Studio currently only supports `Node.js` and `Axios`. In the future we will support other programming languages as well.

## What You Need to Know

- Familiarity with [Livepeer Studio core concepts](/aboutstudio)
- Experience working with `Node.js`
- Experience working with `Axios`

## What You Can Build Here

The following is an annotated list of applications you can build following this tutorial. It includes brief descriptions of use cases with advantages and challenges of each implementation including but not limited to:

| Implementation                                                                                                 | Advantages | Challenges |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Pass in the Livepeer Studio address to YouTube, Twitch,                                                        |            |            |
| Multi-streaming                                                                                                |            |            |
| OBS Professional Broadcasting (e.g. Livestreaming changing camera angles, or multiple "views" within a screen) |            |            |
| Livepeer Studio In-browser Application                                                                         |            |            |
| Livestreaming encoder with more latency                                                                        |            |            |
| Inbrowser platforms (Restream/Streamyard)                                                                      |            |            |
| [Choosing a Streaming-Method](/aboutstudio/usecases-methods)                                                 |            |            |

## Livestreaming Methods

You can choose which method to use to stream for your implementation, e.g.:

- Livepeer Stream to Zoom using the transcoding network
- [Inbrowser platforms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tl_CsOmZT1_ExxVu6IdcoPOTJwcxQA015scsfULyKgk/edit#heading=h.daphfpfvg4hn) (e.g., Streamyard, Restream, Agora (with their own transcoding while sending the signal to Livepeer))
- Mobile livestreaming, e.g. Larix applications, while transcoding on our network, placing a video player for streaming

## Technical Preparation

Before getting started, you can set up your environment to prepare for developing your application:

- **Operating System:** Livepeer Studio services can be run on any operating system
- **IDE:** You can use any development environment that supports your library (VS Code, Sublime, etc.)

1. **[Sign up for a free Livepeer account](https://livepeer.studio/login)**
1. [Get an API key](https://livepeer.studio/docs/guides/start-live-streaming/api-key)
1. Download and install [OBS](https://obsproject.com/)
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
1. Install [Axios](https://axios-http.com/)
1. Access the [Livepeer API Reference](https://livepeer.studio/docs/api-reference)


## Create a Livestream

1.  To create a stream you will need to get the following parameters:

- A `Stream key`,
- An `RTMP ingest URL`
- A `playbackURL`

<!-- link the above to existing documentation-->

> **Note:** Be sure to store them to access for future steps.

### Request

The following request will return:

- `playbackId`
- `id` of the stream
- `streamKey` available

> **Note:** These parameters will be used in [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) along with an `id` to enable recording for the stream.

<!-- link the above to existing documentation-->

```js
const axios = require("axios");
const rtmpURL = "https://livepeer.studio/api";
const playbackURL = "https://livepeercdn.com/hls/{playbackId}/index.m3u8";

const createStream = async () => {
  const response = await axios.post("https://livepeer.studio/api/stream", {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.LV_API_KEY}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    data: JSON.stringify({
      name: "test_stream",
      profiles: [
        {
          name: "720p",
          bitrate: 2000000,
          fps: 30,
          width: 1280,
          height: 720,
        },
        {
          name: "480p",
          bitrate: 1000000,
          fps: 30,
          width: 854,
          height: 480,
        },
        {
          name: "360p",
          bitrate: 500000,
          fps: 30,
          width: 640,
          height: 360,
        },
      ],
    }),
  });
  console.log(JSON.stringify(response.data));
};
```

### Response

```JSON
{
   "lastSeen": 0,
   "isActive": false,
   "record": false,
   "suspended": false,
   "sourceSegments": 0,
   "transcodedSegments": 0,
   "sourceSegmentsDuration": 0,
   "transcodedSegmentsDuration": 0,
   "sourceBytes": 0,
   "transcodedBytes": 0,
   "profiles": [
       {
           "name": "720p",
           "bitrate": 2000000,
           "fps": 30,
           "width": 1280,
           "height": 720
       },
       {
           "name": "480p",
           "bitrate": 1000000,
           "fps": 30,
           "width": 854,
           "height": 480
       },
       {
           "name": "360p",
           "bitrate": 500000,
           "fps": 30,
           "width": 640,
           "height": 360
       }
   ],
   "name": "test_stream",
   "kind": "stream",
   "userId": "eada599f-3d58-499b-ba24-c7f3faf988de",
   "renditions": {},
   "id": "05b0b7b7-c6aa-45b8-a947-6c11997a3efd",
   "createdAt": 1654273038907,
   "streamKey": "05b0-nyoa-jf0p-s2x8",
   "playbackId": "05b0572n8voz1t4w",
   "createdByTokenName": "Test",
   "multistream": {
       "targets": []
   }
}
```

From the API response, we now have:

- A `playbackId` for our `playbackURl`
- The `id` of the stream to enable the recording for the stream
- A `streamKey` to use in OBS

2. Include these variables for later use:

**For example:**

### Request

```js
let playBackId = "05b0572n8voz1t4w";
let id = "05b0b7b7-c6aa-45b8-a947-6c11997a3efd";
let streamKey = "05b0-nyoa-jf0p-s2x8";
```

### Response

The flag for `"record": false` should appear in the API response. 

> **Note:** This is the default setting, and indicates the ability to record and save the live stream for later views is not yet active. You will be able to change this in the following steps.

## Record a Livestream

The default of `record` is set to `off` for a newly created stream.The following settings are required to set up your recording.

## Enable Recording

1. You will make the request to turn the recording setting `on` and record your stream:

### Request

```js
const recordOn = async () => {
  const response = await axios.patch(
    "https://livepeer.studio/api/stream/{id}/record",
    {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.LV_API_KEY}`,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      data: JSON.stringify({
        record: true,
      }),
    }
  );
  console.log(JSON.stringify(response.data));
};
```

### Response 

The response should return a `204` message.

## Start Streaming With OBS

Now that you have created a new stream and turned on the recording, you can start streaming in OBS.

1. First, follow the [OBS tutorial](/guides/livestreaming/obs). 

## Verify the stream is running

2. Once you complete the OBS Tutorial, you can verify that the stream is running by setting the following value:

 ```
 /api/stream?streamsonly=1&filters=[{"id": isActive, "value": true}
 ``` 


### Request

```js
const streamOn = async () => {
 const response = await axios.get("https://livepeer.studio/api/stream?streamsonly=1&filters=[{"id": "isActive", "value": true}", {
   headers: {
     'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.LV_API_KEY}`,
     'Content-Type': 'application/json'
   },
   data: JSON.stringify({
     "record": true
 })
 });
  console.log(JSON.stringify(response.data));
}
```

### Response

```json

"isActive": true

```

Once the live stream is complete, you can stop the stream after 6 minutes from the end of the streaming session.

## List Recorded Sessions

1. Confirm that the session has been recorded:

### Request

```js
const getRecording = async () => {
  const response = await axios.get(
    "https://livepeer.studio/api/stream/{id}/sessions?record=1",
    {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.LV_API_KEY}`,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
    }
  );
  console.log(JSON.stringify(response.data));
};
```

### Response

```json
"createdAt": 1654285544854,
       "ingestRate": 0,
       "renditions": {},
       "outgoingRate": 0,
       "recordingStatus": "ready",
       "recordingUrl": "https://livepeercdn.com/recordings/05b0b7b7-c6aa-45b8-a947-6c11997a3efd/index.m3u8",
       "mp4Url": "https://livepeercdn.com/recordings/05b0b7b7-c6aa-45b8-a947-6c11997a3efd/source.mp4"
```


## Import an Asset

Livepeer automatically imports a recording. However, there is an [Import API for Video On Demand (VOD)](/references/vod/import) implementations.

## List Assets

Retrieve the `playbackURL` to play the recording"

2. Get the `playbackURL`:

### Request

- Use `/api/asset`

```js
const getPlaybackURL = async () => {
  const response = await axios.get("https://livepeer.studio/api/asset", {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.LV_API_KEY}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
  });
  console.log(JSON.stringify(response.data));
};
```

### Response

This returns the `playbackURL` at the bottom of the response which we will use to view the recording.

## Check a Recorded Video

There are different options to check the recorded video.

**For example:**

You can check a recorded video via [Bitmovin test player](https://bitmovin.com/demos/stream-test?format=dash&manifest=https%3A%2F%2Fbitmovin-a.akamaihd.net%2Fcontent%2FMI201109210084_1%2Fmpds%2Ff08e80da-bf1d-4e3d-8899-f0f6155f6efa.mpd)

1. Copy and paste your `playbackURL` in the `Stream box` and `select` the option for `HLS`.

2. To see the recorded live stream:

- Click the  `Load Settings` button when you press `play`.

3. For other options of playback:

- ***For Safari web browser only***,  you can directly paste the `playbackURL` in the address bar.

- ***Alternatively**, you can build your own video player: ***See*** [How to implement a player in the front end](https://github.com/codentell/livepeer-player-tutorial)
