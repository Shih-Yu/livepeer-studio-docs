title: Quick Start
---

This Quick Start guide includes a step-by-step process to get you started developing an application with the Livepeer Studio API (for `Node.js` and `Axios` apps). With the tools we provice, you will be able to develop an application following a complete Livestreaming cycle and best practice guidelines:

- [Create a livestream](/guides#create-a-livestream)
- [Record the livestream](/guides#toggle-the-recording)
- [Play back the livestream](/guides#get-a-list-of-recorded-sessions) using the [Livepeer Studio API](/references) with `Node.js` and `Axios`

> **Note:** Athough the above is not restricted to `Node.js` and `Axios` -- Livepeer Studio currently only supports `Node.js` and `Axios`. In the future we will support other programming languages as well.

## What you need to know

- Familiarity with [Livepeer Studio core concepts](/aboutstudio)
- Experience working with `Node.js`
- Experience working with `Axios`

## What You Can Build Here

The following is an annotated list of applications you can build following this tutorial. It includes brief descriptions of use cases with advantages and challenges of each implementation including but not limited to:

| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Pass in the Livepeer Studio address to YouTube, Twitch,                                                        |            |            |
| Multi-streaming                                                                                                |            |            |
| OBS Professional Broadcasting (e.g. Livestreaming changing camera angles, or multiple "views" within a screen) |            |            |
| Livepeer Studio In-browser Application                                                                         |            |            |
| Livestreaming encoder with more latency                                                                        |            |            |
| Inbrowser platforms (Restream/Streamyard)                                                                      |            |            |
| [Choosing a Streaming-Method](https://www.notion.so/livepeer/)                                                 |            |            |

## Livestreaming Methods

You can choose which method to use to stream for your implementation, e.g.:

- Livepeer Stream to Zoom using the transcoding network
- [Inbrowser platforms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tl_CsOmZT1_ExxVu6IdcoPOTJwcxQA015scsfULyKgk/edit#heading=h.daphfpfvg4hn) (e.g., Streamyard, Restream, Agora (with their own transcoding while sending the signal to Livepeer))
- Mobile livestreaming, e.g. Larix applications, while transcoding on our network, placing a video player for streaming

## Technical Preparation

Before getting started, you can set up your environment to prepare for developing your application:

- **Operating System:** Livepeer Studio services can be run on any operating system
- **IDE:** You can use any development environment that supports your library (VS Code, Sublime, etc.)

1. Install [Axios](https://axios-http.com/)
1. [Livepeer API Reference](https://livepeer.studio/docs/api-reference)


## Creating a Livestream

1.  To create a stream you will need to get:

- A `Stream key`,
- An `RTMP ingest URL`
- A `playbackURL`

<!-- link the above to existing documentation-->

> **Note:** Be sure to store these so that you will have access to them for future steps.

The following request will return:

- `playbackId`,
- `id` of the stream,
- `streamKey` available.

They will be used in [OBS](https://obsproject.com/), with the `id` to enable recording for the stream.

<!-- link the above to existing documentation-->

### Request

```js
const axios = require("axios");
const rtmpURL = "https://livepeer.studio/api";
const playbackURL = "https://livepeercdn.com/hls/{playbackId}/index.m3u8";

const createStream = async () => {
  const response = await axios.post("https://livepeer.studio/api/stream", {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.LV_API_KEY}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    data: JSON.stringify({
      name: "test_stream",
      profiles: [
        {
          name: "720p",
          bitrate: 2000000,
          fps: 30,
          width: 1280,
          height: 720,
        },
        {
          name: "480p",
          bitrate: 1000000,
          fps: 30,
          width: 854,
          height: 480,
        },
        {
          name: "360p",
          bitrate: 500000,
          fps: 30,
          width: 640,
          height: 360,
        },
      ],
    }),
  });
  console.log(JSON.stringify(response.data));
};
```

### Response

```JSON
{
   "lastSeen": 0,
   "isActive": false,
   "record": false,
   "suspended": false,
   "sourceSegments": 0,
   "transcodedSegments": 0,
   "sourceSegmentsDuration": 0,
   "transcodedSegmentsDuration": 0,
   "sourceBytes": 0,
   "transcodedBytes": 0,
   "profiles": [
       {
           "name": "720p",
           "bitrate": 2000000,
           "fps": 30,
           "width": 1280,
           "height": 720
       },
       {
           "name": "480p",
           "bitrate": 1000000,
           "fps": 30,
           "width": 854,
           "height": 480
       },
       {
           "name": "360p",
           "bitrate": 500000,
           "fps": 30,
           "width": 640,
           "height": 360
       }
   ],
   "name": "test_stream",
   "kind": "stream",
   "userId": "eada599f-3d58-499b-ba24-c7f3faf988de",
   "renditions": {},
   "id": "05b0b7b7-c6aa-45b8-a947-6c11997a3efd",
   "createdAt": 1654273038907,
   "streamKey": "05b0-nyoa-jf0p-s2x8",
   "playbackId": "05b0572n8voz1t4w",
   "createdByTokenName": "Test",
   "multistream": {
       "targets": []
   }
}
```

From the API response, we now have our `playbackId`, `id` of the stream, and the `streamKey` available.

We will need the:

- `playbackId` for our `playbackURl`
- the `id` of the stream to enable the recording for the stream
- `streamKey` to use in OBS

2. Place the following in variables for later use:

```js
let playBackId = "05b0572n8voz1t4w";
let id = "05b0b7b7-c6aa-45b8-a947-6c11997a3efd";
let streamKey = "05b0-nyoa-jf0p-s2x8";
```

The flag for `"record": false` should appear in the API response, indicating the ability to record and save the live stream for later views.

### Toggle the recording

2. Since the default of the record is off for a newly created stream, we will turn it on to record our stream.

```js
const recordOn = async () => {
  const response = await axios.patch(
    "https://livepeer.studio/api/stream/{id}/record",
    {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.LV_API_KEY}`,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      data: JSON.stringify({
        record: true,
      }),
    }
  );
  console.log(JSON.stringify(response.data));
};
```

The response should be a `204`


### Start Streaming with OBS

Now that you have created a new stream and turned on the recording, you can start streaming in OBS.


1. To start streaming, follow the [OBS tutorial](https://livepeer.studio/blog/stream-into-livepeer-video-services-first-time)

To verify that the stream is on, use:

 `/api/stream?streamsonly=1&filters=[{"id": "isActive", "value": true}` 


```js
const streamOn = async () => {
 const response = await axios.get("https://livepeer.studio/api/stream?streamsonly=1&filters=[{"id": "isActive", "value": true}", {
   headers: {
     'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.LV_API_KEY}`,
     'Content-Type': 'application/json'
   },
   data: JSON.stringify({
     "record": true
 })
 });
  console.log(JSON.stringify(response.data));
}
```


### Response


```json

"isActive": true

```

Once the live stream is complete, you can stop the stream after 6 minutes from the end of the streaming session.



## Get a list of recorded sessions

1. You can confirm that the session is has been recorded:

#### Request

```js
const getRecording = async () => {
  const response = await axios.get(
    "https://livepeer.studio/api/stream/{id}/sessions?record=1",
    {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.LV_API_KEY}`,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
    }
  );
  console.log(JSON.stringify(response.data));
};
```

#### Response

```json
"createdAt": 1654285544854,
       "ingestRate": 0,
       "renditions": {},
       "outgoingRate": 0,
       "recordingStatus": "ready",
       "recordingUrl": "https://livepeercdn.com/recordings/05b0b7b7-c6aa-45b8-a947-6c11997a3efd/index.m3u8",
       "mp4Url": "https://livepeercdn.com/recordings/05b0b7b7-c6aa-45b8-a947-6c11997a3efd/source.mp4"
```

### Import an asset

Livepeer automatically imports a recording. However, there is an [Import API for Video On Demand (VOD)](/references/vod/import) implementations.

### List asset

Now that our recorded live stream is stored, let's retrieve the `playbackURL` so that we can play it

To get the `playbackURL`, we will use `/api/asset`

```js
const getPlaybackURL = async () => {
  const response = await axios.get("https://livepeer.studio/api/asset", {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.LV_API_KEY}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
  });
  console.log(JSON.stringify(response.data));
};
```

Response

```json

  "id": "2a36cec4-40e1-4ece-9a21-f24b632901c1",
  "hash": [
    {
      "hash": "9c0871abb5a23757b681485a3eb1fe66",

      {
        "type": "audio",
        "codec": "aac",
        "bitrate": 159859,
        "channels": 2,
        "duration": 2.005313,
        "sampleRate": 48000
      },
      {
        "fps": 30,
        "type": "video",
        "codec": "h264",
        "width": 1280,
        "height": 720,
        "bitrate": 2863648,
        "duration": 2,
        "pixelFormat": "yuv420p"
      }
    ],
    "duration": 2.005313
  },
  "playbackId": "05b0k8kughw7o6ml",
  "downloadUrl": "https://livepeercdn.com/asset/05b0k8kughw7o6ml/video"
}
```

At the bottom of the response, there is the `playbackURL`, which we will use to view it.

There are different options to check the recorded video, in this tutorial we will use the [Bitmovin test player](https://bitmovin.com/demos/stream-test?format=dash&manifest=https%3A%2F%2Fbitmovin-a.akamaihd.net%2Fcontent%2FMI201109210084_1%2Fmpds%2Ff08e80da-bf1d-4e3d-8899-f0f6155f6efa.mpd)

Copy and paste the `playbackURL` in the Stream box and select the HLS option.

Click the blue button `Load Settings` when you press play, and you should see the recorded live stream.

- For other options of playback, you can directly paste the `playbackURL` in the address bar if using the Safari web browser only, otherwise, you can build your own video player.
