## Making requests on the API

You need an API key to make requests of the Livepeer Studio API. 

## Using the Dashboard

You do not need to create an API key if you are creating and configuring livestreams using only the Livepeer Studio Dashboard.

> **Note:** Livestream Studio Dashboard is intended for viewing and testing work done with the API. 

For information on how to get an API key visit the [`Get an API key`](/guides/livestreaming/api-key) guide.

## Usage

To use an API key, simply add an `Authorization` header to your request with the `Bearer` scheme and the API key as the value. Example:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {api_key}'
  https://livepeer.studio/api/user/me
```
