## Go live using an in-browser broadcaster

If downloading OBS feels cumbersome, there are a few in-browser broadcaster
options. Livepeer Studio users have had success with:

- [Streamyard](https://streamyard.com/)
- [Restream Studio](https://restream.io/)

### Using [Streamyard](https://streamyard.com/) with Livepeer:

1. Pick "Destinations"
2. Click "Add a destination"
3. Pick "Custom RTMP"
4. Input `rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.studio/live` in the "RTMP Server URL" text field.
5. Copy your stream key into the "Stream key" field
6. Input a name for the stream in "Nickname"
7. Click "Add RTMP server"
8. When you are ready to start your live stream, click "Create a broadcast" and
   pick the destination you just created, enter the studio, and click the "Go
   live" button.

### Using [Restream Studio](https://restream.io/) studio with Livepeer:

## Playback Your Livestream

1. Navigate to your stream detail page in the Livepeer Studio Dashboard, and copy the
Playback URL. 

**The playback URL** is an M3U8 file, the basis for the HTTP Live
Streaming (HLS) format.

Livepeer Studio does not have its own player, but works with open source and 3rd
party players. For this tutorial, we will use
[Theo Player’s demo player](https://demo.theoplayer.com/test-your-stream-with-statistics).

Paste your playback URL in the text field at the top of Theo Player’s demo
player and click to load your stream. You may need to also press the Play button
in the player.

That’s it! Streaming with Livepeer Studio is that simple. To get in touch, fill out
